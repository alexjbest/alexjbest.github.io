In recent years, a new approach has been developed to study the arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves \(y^2 = f(x)\) over local fields with odd residue characteristic via combinatorial data associated to the roots of \(f\). Since its introduction, numerous papers have used this machinery of “cluster pictures” to compute a plethora of arithmetic invariants of these curves. The purpose of this user’s guide is to summarise and centralise all of these results in a self-contained fashion, complemented by an abundance of examples.</p>
