<p>
We present a database of rational elliptic curves up to $\QQ$-isomorphism with good reduction outside $\{2,3,5,7,11,13\}$. We provide a heuristic involving the $abc$ and BSD conjectures that the database is likely to be the complete set of such curves.
Moreover, proving completeness likely needs only more computation time to conclude.
We present data on the distribution of various quantities associated to curves in the set.
We also discuss the connection to $S$-unit equations and the existence of rational elliptic curves with maximal conductor.</p>
