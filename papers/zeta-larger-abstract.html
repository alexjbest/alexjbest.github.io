We describe an algorithm to compute the zeta function of a cyclic cover of the projective line over a finite field of characteristic p that runs in time p1/2+o(1). 
We confirm its practicality and effectiveness by reporting on the performance of our SageMath implementation on a range of examples. 
The algorithm relies on Gon√ßalves's generalization of Kedlaya's algorithm for cyclic covers, and Harvey's work on Kedlaya's algorithm for large characteristic.
