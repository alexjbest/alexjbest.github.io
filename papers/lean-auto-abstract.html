<p>When producing large formally verified mathematical developments that make use of typeclasses it is
easy to introduce overly strong assumptions for theorems and definitions. We consider the problem of
recognizing from the elaborated proof terms when typeclass assumptions are stronger than necessary.
We introduce a metaprogram for the Lean theorem prover that finds and informs the user about possible
generalizations.</p>
