We give an introductory account of two recent approaches towards an effective proof of the Mordell conjecture, due to Lawrence-Venkatesh and Kim. The latter method, which is usually called the method of Chabauty-Kim or non-abelian Chabauty in the literature, has the advantage that in some cases it has been turned into an effective method to determine the set of rational points on a curve, and we illustrate this by presenting three new examples of modular curves where this set can be determined.
