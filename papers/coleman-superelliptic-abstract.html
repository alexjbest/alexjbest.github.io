Since Kedlaya first introduced a \(p\)-adic algorithm for computing zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves, many related algorithms for computing both zeta functions and Coleman integrals on various classes of algebraic curves have been studied. These algorithms compute in the Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology or the rigid cohomology of the curve to determine the action of Frobenius on this cohomology.

We give a new algorithm for explicitly computing Coleman integrals on superelliptic curves over unramified extensions of \(p\)-adic fields. The runtime is softly linear with respect to the square root of the size of the residue field, bringing the runtime in line with that of the corresponding zeta function algorithms. We also describe the implementation of this algorithm in Nemo, a new package for the Julia programming language, which adds functionality for computational number theory. We compare Nemo with other systems in use in this area.
